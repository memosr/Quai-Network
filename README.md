A BRIEF ARTICLE OF QUAI NETWORK

Quai Network is the only decentralized cryptocurrency with the capacity to scale to all global commerce. 
Quai is a merge-mined network of blockchains. This network is able to coordinate an infinite




Key Features

Merge-Mined Hierarchy

All of Quai blockchains are organized into a three-tiered network hierarchy. Each miner must mine three blockchains within the network simultaneously. Merged mining allows miners to increase throughput while also reusing hash to secure






multiple blockchains, making mining up to 10,000 more energy efficient*.

Multithreaded

Current blockchains are unable to provide enough block space to find reasonable market equivalence with demand, leading to high gas fees during periods of sustained usage.





Quai Network introduces multithreaded blockchain execution, which drastically increases the available supply of block space across many interconnected blockchains. 
Through the use of multithreaded execution, Quai Network is able to process upwards of 50,000








transactions per seconds 

Infinitely Scalable

Through the use of the Proof-of-Entropy-Minima consensus mechanism, which eliminates all contention from consensus, Quai Network is able to remain in consensus while coordinating an infinitely growing number of execution shards.
